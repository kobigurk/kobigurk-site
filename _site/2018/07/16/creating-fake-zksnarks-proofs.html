<h1 id="creating-fake-zksnark-proofs">Creating fake zkSNARK proofs</h1>

<p>As you may know, zkSNARKs are a way to create Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
Specifically, succinct and non-interactive ones.</p>

<p>Explaining what they are exactly is a bit too much for this post, so I refer you
to the following:</p>

SNARK</a> — a series of

</ol>

<p>In QED-it we use zkSNARKs, among other tools, to create Zero-Knowledge
Blockchains for the enterprise.</p>

<p>The production deployment of zkSNARKs that is most known is probably
<a href="http://z.cash/" target="_blank">Zcash</a> — a cryptocurrency with unlinkable transactions and
hidden amounts. Zcash, and some others utilizing zkSNARKs, are based on a
construction called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279" target="_blank">Pinnochio</a>, although more
specifically <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879" target="_blank">BCTV14a</a>.</p>

<p>This is a marvelous technology, and as you might suspect, nothing is for free!
There’s a notable downside to this construction — the “trusted setup”.</p>

<h3 id="trusted-setup">Trusted Setup</h3>

<p>The setup is a process where the CRS (Common Reference String) is generated, or
more publicly known as the pair of proving and verification keys. These “keys”
are used by the prover and verifer to generate and verify proofs for a specific
problem (or constraint system), respectively.</p>

<p>In this process, there are random elements which are sampled and must be kept
secret — if the prover knows them, they will be able to create proofs which are
verified successfully, without using an actual solution to the problem during
the proving process. In other words, to forge proofs and break soundness. This
randomness is also known as “toxic waste”.</p>

<p>There are ways to avoid this worry and not put trust in a single entity. For
public circuits, these usually involve a Multi-Party Computation — a process in
which multiple players donate their own randomness, which they destroy
afterwards. The interesting fact is that it’s enough that one player is honest
and destroys their randomness for the whole process to be secure.</p>

<p>Some notable examples of using MPCs to do trusted setup are again, by Zcash:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/ceremony/" target="_blank">“The Ceremony” podcast</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/powers-of-tau/" target="_blank">Powers of Tau</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You might notice this “Tau” that popped up there…</p>

<p>Not to insult any random element — Tau is very important to be kept secret With
Tau known to the prover — it’s very easy to forge a proof!</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-proof">Creating a proof</h3>

<p>Let’s take a quick look at the construction presented in
<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879" target="_blank">BCTV14a</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dnAJcVRk2Oagos7wtvnnhw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s math-heavy, so let’s cherry-pick bits of details relevant to this post:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tau is a point in a finite field sampled at random, part of the “toxic waste”,
during the setup process.</li>
  <li>The prover, during the proving process, calculates some polynomials — A(z),B(z)
and C(z), which are derived from the constraint system and the public and
private inputs to the solution. Essentially, these polynomials represent
constraints of the form “a<em>b=c”, or equivalently “a</em>b-c=0”.</li>
  <li>The prover also calculates H(z) = (A(z)B(z)-C(z))/Z(z), where Z(z) is a publicly
known polynomial which zeros at the points representing the constraint system.
Take note that since A,B and C take the inputs of the prover into account, H can
only be calculated when the numerator also zeros at the same points — attesting
to the fact the prover actually knows a solution to the problem, that which
yields A*B-C = 0.</li>
</ol>

<p>The important part happens now — the prover, while not knowing Tau, can
calculate “in-the-exponent” H(z) evaluated at Tau — H(Tau)!</p>

<p>Why do we do that? Since by evaluating at the random point Tau, the prover shows
with high probability that the equation H=(A*B-C)/Z holds for all z. From a
different perspective on the same matter, without knowing Tau, the prover, with
high probability, will not be able to produce a polynomial which receives the
exact same value at that point.</p>

<p>How can we technically do that? By the fact that part of the setup process
generated elements containing all the relevant powers of Tau, hidden in the
exponent, given as pk_Hi. If we have the coefficients of H, we can combine these
and create <script type="math/tex">H(\tau)</script>.</p>

<p>More specifically:</p>

<table class="centeredimg">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GF6Dl1SG775X5jMQM7mBJw.gif" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Calculated H(z) by the prover</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table class="centeredimg">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*i554Rzu3zkesrkaxwzMnSw.gif" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Taken from the proving key, calculated in the setup process</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table class="centeredimg">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*QOOWLUY60c2gyhOFkRLlMg.gif" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Evaluating <script type="math/tex">H(\tau)</script> “in-the-exponent”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The verifier, upon receiving the proof, can check, again in-the-exponent, that
the prover indeed provided coefficients for H which satisfy the relation
H=(A*B-C)/Z, which can only be done if the prover actually knew a solution.</p>

<h3 id="forging-a-proof">Forging a proof</h3>

<p>Now let’s have some fun… What happens if Tau is known? If, by some reason, it
was exposed during the setup process and is known to a malicious prover?</p>

<p>Apparently, it’s very easy to forge a proof — since the equality check for
H=(A<em>B-C)/Z is done is at the specific point Tau, we can use our knowledge of
Tau to create a polynomial which satisfies exactly that! That is, create a
constant polynomial H(z), which just returns (A(Tau)</em>B(Tau)-C(Tau))/Z(Tau) all
the time.</p>

<p>The verifier’s check will pass, and none’s the wiser!</p>

<h3 id="sounds-hard">Sounds hard…</h3>

<p>Not at all — you’re more than welcome to check <a href="https://github.com/QED-it/libsnark-tutorial_forge_proof" target="_blank">this proof-of-concept
code</a>, based on Howard
Wu’s <a href="https://github.com/howardwu/libsnark-tutorial" target="_blank">libsnark-tutorial</a>, and see
for yourself the changes made to the code:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The program sets up a circuit for bit-decomposition — although it c.</li>
  <li>The setup process maliciously saves Tau to disk.</li>
  <li>The prover loads Tau from disk, and uses wrong inputs to the proof. The prover,
knowing Tau, generates the constant polynomial, disregarding the inputs.</li>
  <li>The verifier then verifies the proof successfully — bamboozled!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>I hope this post provided some insight into what is this “toxic waste” that
everyone has been talking about regarding zkSNARKs, and why having it exposed
leads to an easily executable attack vector.</p>
